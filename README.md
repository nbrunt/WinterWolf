##About

December 2010

In my second year at university I built a web browser for a Graphical User Interfaces module. Unfortunately it had to be written in Java, and even more unfortunately it had to use a JEditorPane as the rendering engine with the consequence that it only supports HTML 3.2.

Given these drawbacks, it's not a very practical application. However, the focus was on the user interface, and I feel I managed to design it well. No prizes for guessing where I got my inspiration.

I have decided to release the source code in case anyone is interested in how to build a simple web browser in Java. I've given it the MIT licence, so feel free to mess around and redistribute - just leave the copyright notice intact.
